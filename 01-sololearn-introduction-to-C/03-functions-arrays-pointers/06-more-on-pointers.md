### Pointers and Arrays
#

> - With pointers, we can point to the first element and then use
    `address arithmetic` to traverse the array.

```plaintext
+   : Used to move forward to a memory location.
-   : Used to move backward to a memory location.
```

> - Refer to file `code-06.c` function `pointers_arrays`.
