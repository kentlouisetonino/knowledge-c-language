### Pointers and Arrays
#

> - With pointers, we can point to the first element and then use
    `address arithmetic` to traverse the array.

```plaintext
+   : Used to move forward to a memory location.
-   : Used to move backward to a memory location.
```

> - Refer to file `code-06.c` function `pointers_arrays`.

> - An important concept with arrays is that an `array name` acts as
    a pointer to the first element of the array.

> - Therefore, the statement `ptr = a` can be thought of as `ptr = &a[0]`.

> - Consider the following statement `printf("%d", *a)` to print the first
    element.
