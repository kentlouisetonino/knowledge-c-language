### Arrays
#

> - An `array` is data structure that stores related values with
    the same type.

```c
int prices1[5];
int prices2[5] = { 31, 32, 33, 34, 35 };
int prices3[5] = { 11, 10 };
```

> - The missing values are set to zeroes.

> - An array is stored in contiguous memory locations and cannot
    change size after being declared.
