- (subtraction)
* (multiplication)
/ (division)
% (modulus division)
```

> - C has two division operators: `/` and `%`.

```plaintext
/ Operator
    - Performs differently depending on the data types of the operands.
    - When both operands are int data types, integer division, also
      called truncated division, which removes any remainder to result
      in an integer.
    - When one or both operands are real numbers (float or double), the
      result a real number.
    - If one of the variable is type "float", use the "%f" operator.

% Operator
    - Returns only the remainder of integer division.
    - It cannot be performed on floats and doubles.
