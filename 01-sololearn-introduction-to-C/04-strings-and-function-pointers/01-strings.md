## Strings

> - A `string` in C is an array of characters that ends <br />
    with a `NULL CHARACTER` `\0`.

> - Below are some of string declaration.

```c
char str_name[str_len] = "string";
```

> - When you provide a `string literal` to initialize the <br />
    string, the compiler automatically adds a `NULL` character <br />
    `'0'` to the char array.
