### The For Loop
#

> - The `for` statement is a loop that executes statements a fixed
    number of times.

```c
for (initValue; condition; increment) {
    statements;
}
```

> - The `initValue` is a counter set to an initial value and
    performed only once.

> - The `condition` is a Boolean expression that compares the
    counter to a value before each loop iteration, stopping the
    loop when false is returned.

> - The `increment` increases (or decreases) the counter by a set
    value.
