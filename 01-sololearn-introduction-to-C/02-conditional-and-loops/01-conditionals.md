### Conditionals
#

> - `Conditionals` are used to perform different computations
    or actions depending on whether a condition evaluates to
    true or false.

> - `if` statement is called a `conditional structure`
    because it executes statements when an expression is true.

> - `if` statement is also known as a `decision structure`.

> - Refer to `code-01.c` function `ifStatement()`.

```c
if (expression) {
    statements;
}
```
