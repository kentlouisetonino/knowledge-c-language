### Logical Operators
#

> - Logical operators `&&` and `||` are used to form a compound
    Boolean expression that tests multiple conditions.

> - A third logical operator is `!` used to reversed the state
    of a Boolean expression.

> - The logical `AND` operator `&&` returns a true result only
    when both expressions are true.
