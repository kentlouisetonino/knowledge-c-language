## $\textnormal{Structures}$

> - A `Structure` is a user-defined data type that groups related <br />
    variables of different data types.

> - A `Structure Declaration` includes the keyword `struct`, a <br />
    for referencing the structure, and curly braces { } with a <br />
    list of variable declarations called `members`.

```c
struct course {
    int id;
    char title[40];
    float hours;
};
```

> - A `Structure` is also called a `composite` or `aggregate` data <br />
    type and some languages refer it as `records`.
